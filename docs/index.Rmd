Welcome, I am a development economist with a focus on behaviour change, gender, climate change, social protection and mental well-being. My research interests also includes Labour Markets, Social Norms, Financial Inclusion, Accountability, and Donations. I work on projects in Ethiopia, India, Malawi, Mauritania, Kenya, Uganda, Sri Lanka and Ireland. 

I am currently an Assistant Professor in Development Practice in the Department of Geography at  Trinity College Dublin, where I teach on gender and development, theories of development, impact evaluation and lead the dissertation module. Prior to this I was a research fellow, a Marie Curie postdoctoral researcher (CAROLINE) and Irish Research Council PhD student in development economics at Trinity College Dublin.  I have a PhD in Development Economics from Trinity College Dublin.  I also received a master’s degree in Public Administration in International Development from the Harvard Kennedy School.

I have a strong background in economic policy and development practice, with experience working with local and international NGOs, as well as international organisations. Prior to my PhD, I worked with Trócaire, an Irish NGO, leading on policy research, including Leading Edge 2020. Before moving to Ireland, I worked in the Poverty Reduction Group at the World Bank, where I did research and published on impact evaluations, poverty maps and poverty monitoring systems. I have also worked with a local NGOs in the USA on resettlement. I grew up in rural India around my parents work on rights and development.
