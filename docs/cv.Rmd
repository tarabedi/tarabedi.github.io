#### **CURRENT RESEARCH PROJECTS**

**RANDOMISED CONTROL TRIALS**

* *Gender impacts from the Graduation Programme in Malawi:* Designed, secured funding and implemented a randomised control trial (RCT), which studies the impact of varying the gender of the recipient of an anti-poverty programme and a gender empowerment training on intrahousehold bargaining power, well-being, and household poverty. We incorporate a qualitative impact protocol so that we can better understand participants’ own interpretation of the programme’s impact on their lives. Affiliated authors and institutions: Tara Bedi, James Copestake, Michael King, and Julia Vaillant. Trinity College Dublin, Africa Gender Innovation Lab World Bank, University of Bath.<br>

* *Gender, Social Norms and the Mauritania Social Transfer Programme:* Designed, secured funding and implemented a RCT on understanding the impact of gender social norms interventions. The RCT tests the effect of adding a) couples empowerment training and b) community interventions to a cash transfer programme on female empowerment, spousal cohesion and welfare outcomes. We incorporate iterative qualitative research to understand the programme's impact across family structures and social groups.
