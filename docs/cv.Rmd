#### **CURRENT RESEARCH PROJECTS**

**RANDOMISED CONTROL TRIALS**


* *Mental Well-Being and School-Related Gender Based Violence, Evidence from Zambia:* Using a randomised control trial (RCT), with randomisation at the school level, this study will evaluate the impact of the empowerment programme on adolescent girls' knowledge of school related gender based violence (SRGBV); attitudes and norms around gender roles, corporal punishment, bullying, sexual violence, and response to SRGBV; socio-emotional skills; mental health and social support. Data will be collected from approximately 3,000 adolescent girls and their teachers/peers/caregivers across three districts in Zambia. Affiliated authors and institutions: Tara Bedi, Wei Chang, Menaal Ebrahim, Anu Jose, Michael King, and Sophia Friedson-Ridenour. Trinity College Dublin, Africa Gender Innovation Lab World Bank.

* *Gender, Social Norms and the Mauritania Social Transfer Programme:* Designed, secured funding and implemented a RCT on understanding the impact of gender social norms interventions. The RCT tests the effect of adding a) couples empowerment training and b) community interventions to a cash transfer programme on female empowerment, spousal cohesion and welfare outcomes.

* *Gender impacts from the Graduation Programme in Malawi:* Designed, secured funding and implemented a randomised control trial (RCT), which studies the impact of varying the gender of the recipient of an anti-poverty programme and a gender empowerment training on intrahousehold bargaining power, well-being, and household poverty. Affiliated authors and institutions: Tara Bedi, Michael King, and Julia Vaillant. Trinity College Dublin, Africa Gender Innovation Lab World Bank.<br>
Research website: https://www.tcd.ie/time/research/malawigraduation/

* *Gender Focused Multi-Faceted Anti-Poverty Programs: Low-Cost Options for Scale-up in Uganda* Designed and secured funding to implement an RCT that tests a) whether we can replicate  our Malawi results in a different setting, with a less intensive group-based graduation program, and at a lower implementation cost, and b) whether impacts are strengthened through adding a low-cost community level intervention. Affiliated authors and institutions: Tara Bedi and Michael King.  Trinity College Dublin. 

* *Gender Dynamics and Climate Resilience for Sri Lanka's poor:*  Designing an RCT that investigates how anti-poverty programmes can build climate resilience through 1) climate-smart agriculture; 2)  family cooperation and gender empowerment;  and 3) the interaction between the two.  Affiliated authors and institutions: Tara Bedi, Thomas Bossuroy, Michael King, and Dalal Moosa. Trinity College Dublin, World Bank.

**MIXED METHODS**

* *Gender Norms and the Mauritania Social Transfer Program:* Designed and secured funding for a qualitative research project on a cash transfer combined with gender norms programming to study 1) the role of complementary programming and the 2) mechanisms underlying the impact of cash transfers on intimate partner violence.The research team will examine the mechanisms of impact and how they vary across different versions of the gender norms programme. This will include investigation of changes at the household level and the possibility of socially transformative changes. The study will use a combination of Qualitative Impact Protocol (QuIP) interviews at the household level, Focus Group Discussions (FDGs) and observational ethnographic research within communities.

**OTHER PROJECTS**

* *Empowering Women Farmers through Precision Agriculture and Market E-Linkages:*  Our mixed methods research  investigates the effect of leveraging agronomically and climate-informed Digital Agricultural Technology (DAT) to provide site-specific advisories on crop management, soil quality, and climate-smart practices, specifically targeting women farmers, on household agriculture productivity, climate adaptation, income and women's empowerment. We are currently designing a lab in the field experiment to disentangle key preferences and take up for digital agriculture technology.

* *Exploring Intra-Household Gender Differences in Reporting Exposure to Shocks:* Poor households are more susceptible to face negative shocks, which may undermine development and anti-poverty interventions. Yet, in attempting to understand households' exposure to shocks, it might be imperative to consider the gender of the respondent when utilising survey-based measures. A growing body of literature is exposing intra-household gender differences in survey reporting of various socio-economic measures, even those seemingly objective. This paper contributes by adding a ``shock''dimension to this literature. Using survey data that captures household shock reports by both the male and female spouse within a household in rural Malawi, the paper aims to establish whether men and women report household shocks differently. Moreover, it seeks to explore possible mechanisms that correlate with spousal concordance, and whether concordance can be associated with women's wellbeing outcomes. The results of this paper will make valuable contributions to research using survey-based measures to study household shocks. For instance, if systematic differences are detected, reliance on responses from only one spouse might entail biases which should be carefully considered when targeting, or evaluating the impact of, development interventions based on these measures.
