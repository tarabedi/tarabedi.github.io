<h4><strong>CURRENT RESEARCH PROJECTS</strong></h4>
<p><strong>RANDOMISED CONTROL TRIALS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Mental Well-Being and School-Related Gender Based Violence,
Evidence from Zambia:</em> Using a randomised control trial (RCT), with
randomisation at the school level, this study will evaluate the impact
of the empowerment programme on adolescent girls’ knowledge of school
related gender based violence (SRGBV); attitudes and norms around gender
roles, corporal punishment, bullying, sexual violence, and response to
SRGBV; socio-emotional skills; mental health and social support. Data
will be collected from approximately 3,000 adolescent girls and their
teachers/peers/caregivers across three districts in Zambia. Affiliated

Jose, Michael King, and Sophia Friedson-Ridenour. Trinity College
Dublin, Africa Gender Innovation Lab World Bank.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Gender, Social Norms and the Mauritania Social Transfer
Programme:</em> Designed, secured funding and implemented a RCT on
understanding the impact of gender social norms interventions. The RCT
tests the effect of adding a) couples empowerment training and b)
community interventions to a cash transfer programme on female
empowerment, spousal cohesion and welfare outcomes. Affiliated authors
and institutions: Tara Bedi, Claire Boxho, Michael King and Julia

class="uri">https://www.tcd.ie/time/research/social-protection/gender_mauritania/</a></p></li>
<li><p><em>Gender impacts from the Graduation Programme in Malawi:</em>
Designed, secured funding and implemented a randomised control trial
(RCT), which studies the impact of varying the gender of the recipient
of an anti-poverty programme and a gender empowerment training on
intrahousehold bargaining power, well-being, and household poverty.

class="uri">https://www.tcd.ie/time/research/malawigraduation/</a></p></li>
<li><p><em>Gender Focused Multi-Faceted Anti-Poverty Programs: Low-Cost
Options for Scale-up in Uganda</em> Designed and secured funding to
implement an RCT that tests a) whether we can replicate our Malawi
results in a different setting, with a less intensive group-based
graduation program, and at a lower implementation cost, and b) whether
impacts are strengthened through adding a low-cost community level
intervention. Affiliated authors and institutions: Tara Bedi and Michael
King. Trinity College Dublin.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Gender Dynamics and Climate Resilience for Sri Lanka’s
poor:</em> Designing an RCT that investigates how anti-poverty
programmes can build climate resilience through 1) climate-smart
agriculture; 2) family cooperation and gender empowerment; and 3) the
interaction between the two. Affiliated authors and institutions: Tara
Bedi, Thomas Bossuroy, Michael King, and Dalal Moosa. Trinity College
Dublin, World Bank.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MIXED METHODS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Gender Norms and the Mauritania Social Transfer Program:</em>
Designed and secured funding for a qualitative research project on a
cash transfer combined with gender norms programming to study 1) the
role of complementary programming and the 2) mechanisms underlying the
impact of cash transfers on intimate partner violence.The research team
will examine the mechanisms of impact and how they vary across different
versions of the gender norms programme. This will include investigation
of changes at the household level and the possibility of socially
transformative changes. The study will use a combination of Qualitative
Impact Protocol (QuIP) interviews at the household level, Focus Group
Discussions (FDGs) and observational ethnographic research within
communities. Affiliated authors and institutions: Tara Bedi, Claire
Boxho, James Copestake, Michael King, Rachael Pierotti, Fiona Remnant

</ul>
<p><strong>OTHER PROJECTS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Empowering Women Farmers through Precision Agriculture and
Market E-Linkages:</em> Our mixed methods research investigates the
effect of leveraging agronomically and climate-informed Digital
Agricultural Technology (DAT) to provide site-specific advisories on
crop management, soil quality, and climate-smart practices, specifically
targeting women farmers, on household agriculture productivity, climate
adaptation, income and women’s empowerment. We are currently designing a
lab in the field experiment to disentangle key preferences and take up
for digital agriculture technology. Affiliated authors and institutions:

<li><p><em>Exploring Intra-Household Gender Differences in Reporting
Exposure to Shocks:</em> Poor households are more susceptible to face
negative shocks, which may undermine development and anti-poverty
interventions. Yet, in attempting to understand households’ exposure to
shocks, it might be imperative to consider the gender of the respondent
when utilising survey-based measures. A growing body of literature is
exposing intra-household gender differences in survey reporting of
various socio-economic measures, even those seemingly objective. This
paper contributes by adding a ``shock’’dimension to this literature.
Using survey data that captures household shock reports by both the male
and female spouse within a household in rural Malawi, the paper aims to
establish whether men and women report household shocks differently.
Moreover, it seeks to explore possible mechanisms that correlate with
spousal concordance, and whether concordance can be associated with
women’s wellbeing outcomes. The results of this paper will make valuable
contributions to research using survey-based measures to study household
shocks. For instance, if systematic differences are detected, reliance
on responses from only one spouse might entail biases which should be
carefully considered when targeting, or evaluating the impact of,
development interventions based on these measures. Affiliated authors
